<h1>To Do List App (HTML, CSS, JS + Node Js Express + EJS + MongoDB, Mongoose + Heroku)</h1>

 ### [See LIVE in the Browser](https://polar-island-34443.herokuapp.com/)

<h2>Description</h2>
This project gives you the opportunity to have your to-do list with a click away. You can enter items, and things to do for the current day, to delete them in real-time. And if you want to have other lists, you can add to the end of the link ../customlist (*customlist - it can be the title you want, for example, the recipe, before you go shopping so you don't forget anything that is necessary). This application offers you superior dynamism on the HTML side with the help of EJS (embedded javascript). I have also integrated the database so that the inserted elements are not deleted, only when you want.
